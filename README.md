🔢 Fibonacci Number Generator (Python)

Welcome to the Fibonacci Number Generator written in Python! This is a simple, interactive terminal-based program that generates Fibonacci numbers either up to a specific count or a maximum value.

🧠 How It Works

The program prompts you to choose how you'd like to generate the sequence:

By count – Enter how many Fibonacci numbers you want.

By maximum value – Enter the maximum value up to which Fibonacci numbers should be generated.


It calculates the Fibonacci sequence based on your selection.

The program then displays the sequence:

If count-based: it prints the first n Fibonacci numbers.

If value-based: it prints all Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to the max value.


After showing the result, it asks if you'd like to generate another sequence or exit the program.
